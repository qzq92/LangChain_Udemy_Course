Substances such as barbiturates, morphine derivatives, and hallucinogens such as mescaline were employed in experiments conducted on Polish, Czech, Jewish, Soviet and other nationalities\\' prisoners of war which aimed to develop a truth serum which would, in the words of one laboratory assistant to Dachau scientist Kurt Plötner, \"eliminate the will of the person examined\". American historian Stephen Kinzer argues that the CIA project was a \"continuation\" of these earlier Nazi experiments, citing the numerous German scientists who were hired to work for the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip.\\nAmerican interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a \"truth drug\" that would produce \"uninhibited truthfulness\" in an interrogated person. In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on human subjects.\\nIn 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of general Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving human subjects, beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird, officially renamed Project Artichoke on August 20, 1951. Directed and overseen by brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, the objective of Artichoke was to determine whether an individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination. Morphine, mescaline and LSD were all administered on unknowing CIA agents in an attempt to produce amnesia in the subjects. In addition, Project Artichoke aimed to employ certain viruses such as dengue fever as potential incapacitating agents.\\n\\n\\n=== Aims and leadership =', metadata={'title': 'MKUltra', 'summary': \"Project MKUltra was an illegal human experiments program designed and undertaken by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop procedures and identify drugs that could be used during interrogations to weaken people and force confessions through brainwashing and psychological torture.

       " Document(page_content='Operation Midnight Climax was an operation carried out by the CIA as a sub-project of Project MKUltra, the mind-control research program that began in the 1950s. It was initially established in 1954 by Sidney Gottlieb and placed under the direction of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in Boston, Massachusetts with the \"Federal Narcotics Agent and CIA consultant\" George Hunter White under the pseudonym of Morgan Hall. Dr. Sidney Gottlieb was a chemist who was chief of the Chemical Division of the Office of Technical Service of the CIA. Gottlieb based his plan for Project MKUltra and Operation Midnight Climax off of interrogation method research under Project Artichoke. Unlike Project Artichoke, Operation Midnight Climax gave Gottlieb permission to test drugs on unknowing citizens, which made way for the legacy of this operation. Hundreds of federal agents, field operatives, and scientists worked on these programs before they were shut down in the 1960s.\\n\\n\\n== Results ==\\nOfficial results of these experiments were not released, but accounts from supervisors of the experiments give little insight to the findings. George Hunter White, an agent at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, and Ira \"Ike\" Feldman, a former military intelligence officer, who oversaw San Francisco experiments, noticed that subjects spoke far more freely when under the influence of a combination of drugs and sex. \"No one knows where they [human test subjects] are now, or what effects they may have suffered.\"\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\n\\n=== History ===\\nOperation Midnight Climax started in 1954 and consisted of a web of CIA-run safehouses in San Francisco at 225c Chestnut Street, San Francisco, CA, and Mill Valley, California, as well as New York City. The safehouses were dramatically scaled back in 1963, following a report by CIA Inspector General John Earman which strongly recommended closing the facility. The San Francisco safehouses were closed in 1965, and the New York City safehouse soon followed in 1966. Operation Midnight Climax and Project MKUltra were considered to be so secretive that few people, even in the highest government positions, knew Gottlieb existed, let alone was conducting these experiments. However, some senior officers in the CIA knew enough about him to connect his work to LSD.\\n\\n\\n=== Objectives and methodology ===\\nOperation Midnight Climax was established in order to study the effects of LSD on non-consenting individuals. Prostitutes on the CIA payroll were instructed to lure clients back to the safehouses, where they were surreptitiously plied with a wide range of substances, including LSD, and monitored behind one-way glass. The prostitutes were instructed in the use of post-coital questioning to investigate whether the victims could be convinced to involuntarily reveal secrets. The victims were sometimes fed subliminal messages in attempts to induce them to involuntary actions, including criminal activity such as robbery, assault, and assassination. Many of the CIA operatives involved in the experiments voluntarily indulged in the drugs and prostitutes for recreational purposes. Additionally, information from Wilmington News Journal on October 15, 1978, reports from a FOIA request that, \"the spy agency purchased two pounds of Yohimbine hydrochloride... by Dr. Robert V. Lashbrook, the chief aide to Dr. Sidney Gottlieb.\" The role of Dr. Lashbrook was to, \"monitor and approve materials for Operation Midnight Climax.\"\\nSenate investigators were told that the goals of these experiments were to study mind control and sexual behavior. More specifically, to learn about the secrets of brainwashing to gain control over enemy spies and protect U.S. agents. Other objectives included finding drugs that could incapacitate entire buildings via poisoned food, which would create \"confusion-anxiety-fear,\" and other symptoms such as headaches and earaches.

Supposedly, she was then forced by the CIA to participate in Project Monarch, which she claims is a subsection of Project MKUltra and Project ARTICHOKE. According to O\\'Brien, under hypnosis she was able to recall memories of sexual abuse—of both herself and her daughter—by international pedophile rings, drug barons, and satanists, who allegedly used a form of \"trauma based mind control programming\" to make her a sex slave.\\nO\\'Brien accuses a wide range of prominent people—from American, Canadian, Mexican, and Saudi Arabian government officials to stars of the country music scene—of being part of a Project Monarch conspiracy to operate sex slave rings and commit child abuse. For example, O\\'Brien claims that George H. W. Bush and Miguel de la Madrid used holograms to appear to her in altered forms, saying, \"Bush apparently activated a hologram of the lizard-like \\'alien,\\' which provided the illusion of Bush transforming like a chameleon before my eyes.

The term punned on the Taoist custom of \"cleansing / washing the heart / mind\" (xǐxīn, 洗心) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.\\nThe earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in Miami News, published in September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken anticommunist and was alleged to be a CIA agent working undercover as a journalist. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950–1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment.\\nThe U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander General Mark W. Clark asserted: \"Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want ... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.\"\\nBeginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton\\'s 1961 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of \"Brainwashing\" in China, was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of \"brainwashing.\"\\nIn 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled Communist Inter', metadata={'title': 'Brainwashing', 'summary': 'Brainwashing, also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and forced re-education, is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques.

The women— one of whom was operated on 30 times— suffered from infections and many failed surgeries before they were finally cured of vaginal fistula. The period during which Sims operated on enslaved women, between 1845 and 1849, was one during which the new practice of anesthesia was not universally accepted as safe and effective.\\nIn 1874, Mary Rafferty, an Irish servant woman, came to Dr. Roberts Bartholow of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio for treatment of a lesion on her head. The lesion was diagnosed as a cancerous ulcer and surgical treatments were attempted. Bartholow saw Rafferty\\'s condition as terminal but felt there was a research opportunity. He inserted electrode needles into her exposed brain matter to gauge her responses. This was done with no intention of treating her.

       " Document(page_content=\"Psychic driving was a psychiatric procedure of the 1950s and 1960s in which patients were subjected to a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter their behaviour. In psychic driving, patients were often exposed to hundreds of thousands of repetitions of a single statement over the course of their treatment. They were also concurrently administered muscular paralytic drugs such as curare to subdue them for the purposes of exposure to the looped message(s). The procedure was pioneered by Donald Ewen Cameron, and used and funded by the CIA's Project MKUltra program in Canada.\\n\\n\\n== Psychiatry and MKUltra ==\\nThe psychic driving procedure was a chronological precursor to Cameron's depatterning, the latter involving massive doses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) combined with similarly large doses of psychedelic drugs (such as LSD). The intent was to break down the subject's personality—theoretically psychic driving could then be used with some efficacy in establishing a new personality. In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure. Such biologically and psychologically devastating procedures, adopted internationally by the psychiatric establishment, were largely abolished by the time the CIA was brought before a Senate Hearing (1977) for its involvement and funding of Cameron's experimental activities—as part of the MKULTRA program. The topic of Cameron's psychic driving is dealt with in some detail in the docudrama entitled The Sleep Room (1998) directed by Anne Wheeler.\\n\\n\\n== Other uses ==\\nSimilar techniques are alleged to have been used in the kidnapping and death of CIA operative William Francis Buckley by Aziz al-Abub, a medical doctor from Beirut who was seen as epitomizing medical torture. Aziz al-Abub, also known as Ibrahim al-Nadhir, was known for using his medical training to refine torture techniques. His techniques were shown to be closely connected to the CIA-developed torture techniques. As with the CIA, he used drugs to make it easier to handle those he tortured, carefully determined how long to keep a prisoner hooded and when to isolate them and other techniques seen as medical torture.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\nInitially, in the hit NBC TV series Hannibal, Dr. Chilton uses psychic driving on a patient of the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Dr. Abel Gideon (played by Eddie Izzard), to convince him that he is the main antagonist of the series, the Chesapeake Ripper. Later in the series, psychic driving is alluded to by the main character Dr. Hannibal Lecter as a means to convince FBI profiler Will Graham that he has committed a string of brutal murders during a bout of encephalitis, to throw him off the trail and keep himself safe. Dr. Lecter uses psychic driving by purposely inducing trance-like states during a therapy session, using Will Graham's encephalitis, then reinforcing his delusions that he has killed during episodes of lost time where he cannot remember his own actions.\\nAaron Dilloway's 2010 album Psychic Driving Tapes is based on the concept, and heavily utilizes tape loops in its composition.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nDonald Ewen Cameron\\nProject MKUltra\\nThe Men Who Stare At Goats\\nWilliam Sargant\\nBehavior modification\\n\\n\\n== Books ==\\nAnne Collins (2002-06-12).

Decades after his own death, the psychic driving technique he developed continued to see extensive use in the torture of prisoners around the world.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and career ==\\nDonald Ewen Cameron was born in Bridge of Allan, Scotland, the oldest son of a Presbyterian minister. He received an M.B., Ch.B. in psychological medicine from the University of Glasgow in 1924, a D.P.M. from the University of London in 1925, and an M.D. with distinction from the University of Glasgow in 1936.\\nCameron began his training in psychiatry at the Glasgow Royal Mental Hospital in 1925. In 1926, he served as assistant medical officer there and was introduced to psychiatrist Sir David Henderson, a student of Swiss-born US psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. He continued his training in the United States under Meyer at the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland from 1926 to 1928 with a Henderson Research Scholarship.\\nIn 1928, Cameron left Baltimore for the Burghölzli, the psychiatric hospital of the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, where he studied under Hans W. Maier, the successor of Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had significantly influenced psychiatric thinking. There he met A. T. Mathers, Manitoba's principal psychiatrist, who convinced Cameron in 1929 to move to Brandon, the second largest city of Manitoba, Canada. Cameron stayed there for seven years and was made physician-in-charge of the Reception Unit of the Provincial Mental Hospital. He also organized the structure of mental health services in the western half of the province, establishing 10 functioning clinics; this model was used as the blueprint for similar efforts in Montreal and a forerunner of 1960s community health models.\\nIn 1933, he married Jean C. Rankine, whom he had met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. She was a former captain of the Scottish field hockey team, a competitive tennis player, and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. They had four children; a daughter and three sons.\\nIn 1936, he moved to Massachusetts to become director of the research division at Worcester State Hospital only 1 year later. In 1936, he also published his first book, Objective and Experimental Psychiatry which introduced his belief that psychiatry should approach the study of human behavior in a rigorous, scientific fashion rooted in biology. His theories of behavior stressed the unity of the organism with the environment; the book also outlined experimental method and research design. Cameron believed firmly in clinical psychiatry and a strict scientific method.\\nIn 1938 he moved to Albany, New York, where he received his diplomate in psychiatry and thus was certified in psychiatry. From 1939 to 1943 he was professor of neurology and psychiatry at Albany Medical College, and at the Russell Sage School of Nursing, also in the Albany area.

His older brother was plant biologist David Gottlieb. A stutterer since childhood, he earned a master\\'s degree in speech therapy from San Jose State University after retiring from the CIA. He was born with a club foot, which got him rejected from military service in World War II but did not prevent his pursuit of folk dancing, a lifelong passion.\\nGottlieb graduated from James Monroe High School in 1936, and enrolled in the free City College in NYC. He decided to transfer to a school that offered a legitimate agricultural biology course, and wished to attend the University of Wisconsin. In order to take the specialized courses he wished to have, he first attended Arkansas Tech University, where he studied botany, organic chemistry, and principles of dairying. His success at ATU won him admission to the University of Wisconsin, where he was mentored by Ira Baldwin, the assistant dean of the College of Agriculture. Gottlieb graduated magna cum laude in 1940. His accomplishments at the university, paired with a glowing recommendation from Baldwin, won him admission to the California Institute of Technology, where he received his Doctorate in Biochemistry in June 1943, writing his thesis on \"Studies of Ascorbic Acid in Cowpeas.\"\\nGottlieb met his wife Margaret Moore, daughter of a Presbyterian missionary, while attending CIT, and they swiftly married. Denied the chance of military service, he sought out another way to serve, and began looking for government work in Washington. By 1948, his wife and two daughters were living in a remote cabin near Vienna, Virginia, that had no electricity or running water. He was living there when he began working for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). His lifestyle was in stark contrast to that of the Ivy League men the CIA normally recruited.\\n\\n\\n== Government career ==\\nGottlieb\\'s first government position was at the Department of Agriculture, where he researched the chemical structure of organic soils. He later transferred to the Food and Drug Administration, where he developed tests to measure the presence of drugs in the human body. Gottlieb grew bored with this work and sought a more challenging position. In 1948, he found a job at the National Research Council, where he described being \"exposed to some interesting work concerning ergot alkaloids as vasoconstrictors and hallucinogens.\" He soon relocated to the University of Maryland as a research associate dedicated to studying metabolisms of fungi.\\nOn July 13, 1951, Gottlieb had his first day of work at the CIA. Then-Deputy Director for Plans Allen Dulles hired him on Ira Baldwin\\'s recommendation. Baldwin had founded and run the biowarfare program at Fort Detrick years earlier, and had kept Gottlieb in his orbit throughout the years. Gottlieb, who had advanced knowledge of poisons, was making his entrance in the early years of the Cold War. In the years after World War II, American paranoia about the infiltration of Communist ideology whipped the country into a nationalistic fervor to protect American cultural and political dominance from a supposed impending Soviet takeover. This also contributed to the CIA rapidly expanding its experimental methods and tactics over the next two decades, in an effort to break down and rebuild the human mind to work in its favor, falsely believing that the USSR and The People\\'s Republic of China had already mastered brainwashing and were using it against their own citizens and prisoners.

Authored by Seymour M. Hersh, it documented an intelligence operation against the anti-war movement, as well as \"break-ins, wiretapping and the surreptitious inspection of mail\" conducted since the 1950s. According to former CIA Official Cord Meyer, these disclosures \"Convinced large sections of the American public that the CIA had become a domestic Gestapo and stimulated an overwhelming demand for the wide-ranging congressional investigations that were to follow.\"\\nHersh had been tipped off to the possibility of an \"in house operation\" by an unidentified member of the CIA in spring of 1974. He embarked on an investigation, speaking to sources that included CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Angleton. Although he was not aware of its existence, Hersh uncovered much information that had been documented in the \"Family Jewels\", a report ordered by Director of Central Intelligence William Colby that chronicled CIA abuses over the past 25 years. The report would not be formally revealed to the public until 2007.\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring of anti-war movement and Project MINARET ===\\n\\nThe article alleged that CIA agents had followed and photographed participants in the antiwar movement, as well as other demonstrations.

He grew up in poverty in Madison. He subsequently attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison for a year and, after completing prerequisite coursework at the University of Iowa under the aegis of the Army Specialized Training Program during World War II, earned his M.D. from the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1949.

While assigned to Lackland Air Force Base after his residency, he was appointed to a panel to discover why 36 of 59 airmen captured in the Korean War had confessed or cooperated in North Korean allegations of war crimes committed by the United States. Amid speculation that the airmen had been brainwashed or drugged, West came to a simpler conclusion: \"What we found enabled us to rule out drugs, hypnosis or other mysterious trickery,\" he said. He observed that \"[i]t was just one device used to confuse, bewilder and torment our men until they were ready to confess to anything. That device was prolonged, chronic loss of sleep.\" The airmen avoided being court-martialed for these events as a result of West\\'s research.\\nHe then published a paper with the title \"United States Airforce prisoners of the Chinese Communist.

       " Document(page_content='Project Artichoke (also referred to as Operation Artichoke) was a project developed and enacted by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of researching methods of interrogation.\\nInitially known as Project Bluebird, Project Artichoke officially arose on August 20, 1951, and was operated by the CIA\\'s Office of Scientific Intelligence. The primary goal of Project Artichoke was to determine whether a person could be involuntarily made to perform an act of attempted assassination. The project also studied the effects of hypnosis, forced addiction to (and subsequent withdrawal from) morphine, and other chemicals, including LSD, to produce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects.\\nProject Artichoke was succeeded by Project MKUltra, which began in 1953.\\n\\n\\n== Description ==\\nProject Artichoke was a mind control program that gathered information together with the intelligence divisions of the Army, Navy, Air Force and FBI. In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that asked, \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"\\nProject Artichoke was the Central Intelligence Agency\\'s secret code name for carrying out in-house and overseas experiments using LSD, hypnosis and total isolation as forms of physiological harassment for special interrogations on human subjects. At first agents used cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote and mescaline, but they increasingly saw LSD as the most promising drug. The subjects who left this project were fogged with amnesia, resulting in faulty and vague memories of the experience. In 1952, LSD was increasingly given to unknowing CIA agents to determine the drug\\'s effects on unsuspecting people. One record states that an agent was kept on LSD for 77 days.\\nArtichoke researched the potential of dengue fever and other diseases. A declassified Artichoke memo read: \"Not all viruses have to be lethal… the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitating agents.\"\\nThe CIA disputed which department would take over the operation. Finally, it was decided that an agent from the CIA research staff, former U.S. Army brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, would oversee it. The CIA sought to establish control over what it perceived as the \"weaker\" and \"less intelligent\" segments of society, or for potential agents, defectors, refugees, prisoners of war and others. A CIA report states that if hypnosis succeeded, assassins could be created to assassinate \"a prominent [redacted] politician or if necessary, [an] American official.\" The overseas operations took place in locations throughout Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Teams were assembled to manage these operations and they were told to \"conduct at the overseas bases operational experiments utilizing aliens as subjects.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCIA activities in the United States\\nFrank Olson\\nMKUltra\\nMKNAOMI\\nMKOFTEN\\nProject CHATTER\\nUnethical human experimentation in the United States\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\nMaret, Susan (2018-02-16). \"Murky Projects and Uneven Information Policies: A Case Study of the Psychological Strategy Board and CIA\".

Eleven appears to have been born a psychic with notable telekinetic and extrasensory abilities. However, when she uses these abilities to a significant degree, she becomes temporarily weakened and her nose bleeds. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised as a test subject at Hawkins National Laboratory in order to develop her psychokinetic skills. When placed in a sensory deprivation tank, she can use remote viewing to access other dimensions, primarily for the purposes of espionage. In addition, Eleven can open and close portals, known as “Gates”, to a parallel dimension called the Upside Down.\\n\\n\\n=== Season 1 ===\\n\\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins National Laboratory wearing only her hospital gown and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. The owner Benny takes pity on her and calls social services while putting her in a long t-shirt associated with the restaurant.

She is encountered by Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), who are looking for their missing friend Will Byers (Noah Schnapp). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short and allows Eleven to live in his basement while providing her with some new clothes. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so Dr. Brenner, whom she calls “Papa” and the people that work for him called “Bad Men”, cannot find her.\\nEleven helps to locate Will and determines that he is trapped in a parallel dimension, which the children dub the \"Upside Down\", where he is being hunted by a creature they call the \"Demogorgon\". The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes they are being led toward Hawkins Laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her; she ends up knocking him unconscious and fleeing. She later steals frozen waffles from a grocery store and eats them in the forest. Mike and Dustin are later threatened by bullies or “Mouth Breathers”; Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a lake while Dustin is held hostage. Eleven returns and intervenes before Mike hits the water, frightening the bullies and saving both Mike and Dustin.\\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends.

At a meeting in rural Maryland, he was covertly dosed with LSD by his colleague \\nSidney Gottlieb (head of the CIA\\'s MKUltra program) and, nine days later, plunged to his death from the window of the Hotel Statler in New York. The U.S. government first described his death as a suicide, and then as misadventure, while others allege murder. The Rockefeller Commission report on the CIA in 1975 acknowledged their having conducted covert drug studies on fellow agents. Olson\\'s death is one of the most mysterious outcomes of the CIA mind control project MKUltra.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Youth and education ===\\nOlson was born to Swedish immigrant parents in Hurley, Iron County, Wisconsin. Olson graduated from Hurley High School in 1927. Olson enrolled at the University of Wisconsin, earning both a B.S. and, in 1938, a Ph.D. in bacteriology. He married his classmate, Alice, and would go on to have three children. Olson enrolled in the Reserve Officers\\' Training Corps to help pay off his college costs, and was called to active duty at Fort Hood in Texas as the United States entered World War II. Olson worked for a short time at Purdue University\\'s Agricultural Experimentation Station before being called to active duty.\\n\\n\\n=== Work with the Army & CIA ===\\nOlson served as a captain in the U.S. Army Chemical Corps. In December 1942, he got a call from Ira Baldwin, his thesis adviser at UW and the future mentor of Sidney Gottlieb, who would go on to be the CIA\\'s leading chemist and director of MK-ULTRA. Ira had been called to leave his University post to direct a secret program regarding the development of biological weapons, and wanted Olson to join him as one of the first scientists at what would become Fort Detrick. The army transferred him to Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. A few months later, the Chemical Corps took over Detrick and established its secret Biologicals Warfare Laboratories.\\nAt Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as George W. Merck and the U.S. military to establish the top secret U.S. bioweapons program beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson also worked with ex-Nazis who had been brought into the country through Operation Paperclip on the utilization of aerosolized anthrax.\\nOlson was discharged from the Army in 1944 and remained at Detrick on a civilian contract, continuing his research into aerobiology. In 1949, he joined many other Detrick scientists in Antigua for Operation Harness, which tested the vulnerability of different animals to toxic clouds. In 1950, he was a part of Operation Sea-Spray, where the bacterium Serratia marcescens was released into the coastal mists of San Francisco through a minesweeper, reaching all of San Francisco\\'s 800,000 residents, as well as people living in eight surrounding cities. Olson traveled often to Fort Terry, a secret army base off Long Island, where toxins too deadly to be brought onto the U.S. mainland were tested.\\nThis was the period where senior military officials and CIA officers were becoming deeply troubled at Soviet progress, and feared they were heading towards mastery of microbe warfare. Their alarm led to the forming of the Special Operations Division at Detrick in spring of 1949, with the purpose of conducting research on covert ways to utilize chemical weapons. SOD was known as a \"Detrick within a Detrick\" due to its level of secrecy. Olson became acting chief of SOD within a year of its creation, originally invited to join by colleague and SOD\\'s first chief, John Schwab.\\nAt some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee.

In 1952, three years after his brother David was born, the family moved to suburban Evergreen Park, Illinois, and Ted transferred to Evergreen Park Central Junior High School. After testing scored his IQ at 167, he skipped the sixth grade. Kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event: previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader, but after skipping ahead of them he felt he did not fit in with the older children, who bullied him.\\nNeighbors in Evergreen Park later described the Kaczynski family as \"civic-minded folks\", one recalling the parents \"sacrificed everything they had for their children\". Both Ted and David were intelligent, but Ted was exceptionally bright. Neighbors described him as a smart but lonely individual.\\n\\n\\n=== High school ===\\nKaczynski attended Evergreen Park Community High School, where he excelled academically.

First came the revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the US Army\\'s spying on the civilian population and Senator Sam Ervin\\'s Senate investigations produced more revelations. Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the \"family jewels\". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.\\nThe creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe Church Committee\\'s final report was published in April 1976 in six books.

René Schneider of Chile and Fidel Castro of Cuba. President Gerald Ford urged the Senate to withhold the report from the public, but failed, and under recommendations and pressure by the committee, Ford issued Executive Order 11905 (ultimately replaced in 1981 by President Reagan\\'s Executive Order 12333) to ban US sanctioned assassinations of foreign leaders.\\nIn addition, the committee produced seven case studies on covert operations, but only the one on Chile was released, titled \"Covert Action in Chile: 1963–1973\".

Prisoners were forced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures.

Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen. At Buchenwald, Carl Værnet conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in an attempt to \"cure\" homosexuality.\\nAfter the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors\\' Trial, and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. During the Nuremberg Trials, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were tried for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences.

The series is based on the life of a scientist, Frank Olson, who worked for a secret government biological warfare program (the USBWL) at Fort Detrick, Maryland. It focuses on the events leading up to and following his controversial death, which the US government originally claimed was a tragic accident, but later admitted was likely a suicide, caused by a mental breakdown brought on after being unknowingly dosed with LSD, while at a meeting with colleagues from the CIA who were involved in Project MKUltra. It also follows Frank Olson\\'s son in the present day, and discusses his belief that his father may have been murdered due to being perceived as a potential security risk. Interspersed between interviews and archival footage, are live action reenactments of the final days of Frank Olson\\'s life and the various theories involving his death.\\n\\n\\n== Synopsis ==\\nWormwood is told through Eric Olson, the son of Frank Olson, an American biological warfare scientist and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1953.\\nNine days after Olson was covertly dosed with LSD by his CIA supervisor as part of Project MKUltra, he plunged to his death from the window of a hotel room in New York City. His death was initially regarded as a suicide, but subsequent investigations have raised questions of a coverup of an alleged murder.\\nThe title Wormwood is a double literary allusion: first to the Bible verse about a star that infects one-third of Earth\\'s waters and makes them bitter and poisonous, a reference to biological weapons (in particular, allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War), and the \\'bitter\\' effect on Eric Olson of his 60-year search for a resolution regarding the death of his father; secondly, to a line in Hamlet (whose story arc the documentary suggests parallels Eric\\'s own life), when Hamlet whispers, \"Wormwood, Wormwood\", at the moment its play-within-a-play implies evidentially that his father was, in fact, assassinated.  The documentary ends with Eric Olson describing the quest for the truth about his father\\'s death as \"Wormwood\", having consumed his whole life and with no possibility that any definitive answer, positive or negative, would have released him from the bitterness of the loss anyway.

It focuses on the events leading up to and following his controversial death, which the US government originally claimed was a tragic accident, but later admitted was likely a suicide, caused by a mental breakdown brought on after being unknowingly dosed with LSD, while at a meeting with colleagues from the CIA who were involved in Project MKUltra. It also follows Frank Olson's son in the present day, and discusses his belief that his father may have been murdered due to being perceived as a potential security risk.

The latter part of the word psychology derives from -λογία -logia, which means \"study\" or \"research\". The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance. In its Latin form psychiologia, it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the decade 1510-1520 The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary. The dictionary refers to \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\"\\nΨ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived, is commonly associated with the field of psychology.\\nIn 1890, William James defined psychology as \"the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions.\" This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who in 1913 asserted that the discipline is a natural science, the theoretical goal of which \"is the prediction and control of behavior.\" Since James defined \"psychology\", the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation. Folk psychology is the understanding of the mental states and behaviors of people held by ordinary people, as contrasted with psychology professionals\\' understanding.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, China, India, and Per', metadata={'title': 'Psychology', 'summary': \"Psychology is the study of mind and behavior.

Under it was the newly formed Office of Special Activities, along with the Office of ELINT and the Office of Research and Development, which were quickly integrated into the DDR. However, the OSI remained part of the Directorate of Operations.\\nIn 1963, Scoville resigned, frustrated by the unwillingness of other departments to transfer their responsibilities. Director of Central Intelligence John McCone asked Albert Wheelon to replace Scoville in the renamed Deputy Directorate of Science and Technology. The OSI was transferred to the Deputy Directorate of Science and Technology, along with the Office of Computer Services.\\nIn 1965, the directorate was renamed to the Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T), and in 1966, Carl Duckett succeeded Wheelon as the Deputy Director for Science and Technology.\\n\\n\\n=== Further changes ===\\nIn April 1973, DCI James Schlesinger transferred the Technical Services Division of the Operations Directorate to the DS&T, where it would be renamed the Office of Technical Services (OTS). Its primary focus was technical support of CIA case officers in the field, including development of exotic weapons and eavesdropping devices and production of forged documents. It developed a poison pen and exploding seashells to assassinate Fidel Castro.\\nIn September 1995, Ruth David replaced James Hirsch as Deputy Director for Science and Technology, and established three new offices: the Clandestine Information Technology Office, the Office of Advanced Analytical Tools, and the Office of Advanced Projects. The Office of Research and Development was simultaneously abolished.\\nIn April 1999, Gary L. Smith became the Deputy Director for Science and Technology and resigned nine months later. DCI George Tenet quickly appointed a new deputy director, Joanne Isham.\\nThe Directorate of Science and Technology is organized to accommodate classified personnel based on their technical strengths. Depending on their background and area of expertise, DS&T has:\\n\\nOperations Tradecraft: Create solutions to current technical problems using existing tools and designs\\nTechnical Research: Researching to find solutions to existing problems using theoretical analysis\\nTechnical Development: Ensuring current projects and intelligence officers are correctly managed through analysis\\nTechnical Analysis: Conducting \"all-source analysis\" to reduce the possibility of security faults, especially for the on-ground intelligence officers\\nWhile DS&T\\'s organizational structure is based on an expertise agenda, meaning employees are placed into one of the four departments based on their previous knowledge and future aspirations, this directorate can be more easily understood by dividing it into two functionalities. The first is the processing and analysis of collected information, and the second is future technological advances and innovations.\\n\\n\\n== Projects ==\\n\\n\\n=== Purpose ===\\nDS&T is one of five directorates within the CIA, with the other four being administration, analysis, operations, and digital innovation. DS&T plays a special role in the CIA since it provides a wide range of data and intelligence to all other directorates. From here, the various other directorates can take this information, analyze it, and effectively procure it for their needs.\\nDS&T has morphed into a vastly elaborate directorate since its inception in 1948.

American historian Stephen Kinzer argues that the CIA project was a \"continuation\" of these earlier Nazi experiments, citing the numerous German scientists who were hired to work for the U.S. as part of Operation Paperclip.\\nAmerican interest in drug-related interrogation experiments began in 1943, when the Office of Strategic Services began developing a \"truth drug\" that would produce \"uninhibited truthfulness\" in an interrogated person. In 1947, the United States Navy initiated Project CHATTER, an interrogation program which saw the first testing of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on human subjects.\\nIn 1950, the Central Intelligence Agency under the direction of general Walter Bedell Smith initiated a series of interrogation projects involving human subjects, beginning with the launch of Project Bluebird, officially renamed Project Artichoke on August 20, 1951. Directed and overseen by brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, the objective of Artichoke was to determine whether an individual could be made to involuntarily perform an act of attempted assassination. Morphine, mescaline and LSD were all administered on unknowing CIA agents in an attempt to produce amnesia in the subjects.

       " Document(page_content='The Chinese term xǐnǎo (洗腦, \"wash brain\") was originally used to describe the coercive persuasion used under the Maoist government in China, which aimed to transform \"reactionary\" people into \"right-thinking\" members of the new Chinese social system. The term punned on the Taoist custom of \"cleansing / washing the heart / mind\" (xǐxīn, 洗心) before conducting ceremonies or entering holy places.\\nThe earliest known English-language usage of the word \"brainwashing\" in an article by a journalist Edward Hunter, in Miami News, published in September 1950. Hunter was an outspoken anticommunist and was alleged to be a CIA agent working undercover as a journalist. Hunter and others used the Chinese term to explain why, during the Korean War (1950–1953), some American prisoners of war (POWs) cooperated with their Chinese captors, and even in a few cases defected to their side. British radio operator Robert W. Ford and British army Colonel James Carne also claimed that the Chinese subjected them to brainwashing techniques during their imprisonment.\\nThe U.S. military and government laid charges of brainwashing in an effort to undermine confessions made by POWs to war crimes, including biological warfare. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote Frank Schwable, Chief of Staff of the First Marine Air Wing admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander General Mark W. Clark asserted: \"Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want ... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.\"\\nBeginning in 1953, Robert Jay Lifton interviewed American servicemen who had been POWs during the Korean War as well as priests, students, and teachers who had been held in prison in China after 1951. In addition to interviews with 25 Americans and Europeans, Lifton interviewed 15 Chinese citizens who had fled after having been subjected to indoctrination in Chinese universities. (Lifton\\'s 1961 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of \"Brainwashing\" in China, was based on this research.) Lifton found that when the POWs returned to the United States their thinking soon returned to normal, contrary to the popular image of \"brainwashing.\"\\nIn 1956, after reexamining the concept of brainwashing following the Korean War, the U.S. Army published a report entitled Communist Inter', metadata={'title': 'Brainwashing', 'summary': 'Brainwashing, also known as mind control, menticide, coercive persuasion,  thought control, thought reform, and forced re-education, is the concept that the human mind can be altered or controlled by certain psychological techniques.

The lesion was diagnosed as a cancerous ulcer and surgical treatments were attempted. Bartholow saw Rafferty\\'s condition as terminal but felt there was a research opportunity. He inserted electrode needles into her exposed brain matter to gauge her responses. This was done with no intention of treating her.

In Cameron's depatterning, the ECT would often continue to be administered despite the manifestation of convulsive fits, which were consensually considered to be contraindications to normal and safe ECT procedure.

In 1926, he served as assistant medical officer there and was introduced to psychiatrist Sir David Henderson, a student of Swiss-born US psychiatrist Adolf Meyer. He continued his training in the United States under Meyer at the Phipps Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland from 1926 to 1928 with a Henderson Research Scholarship.\\nIn 1928, Cameron left Baltimore for the Burghölzli, the psychiatric hospital of the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, where he studied under Hans W. Maier, the successor of Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, who had significantly influenced psychiatric thinking. There he met A. T. Mathers, Manitoba's principal psychiatrist, who convinced Cameron in 1929 to move to Brandon, the second largest city of Manitoba, Canada. Cameron stayed there for seven years and was made physician-in-charge of the Reception Unit of the Provincial Mental Hospital. He also organized the structure of mental health services in the western half of the province, establishing 10 functioning clinics; this model was used as the blueprint for similar efforts in Montreal and a forerunner of 1960s community health models.\\nIn 1933, he married Jean C. Rankine, whom he had met while they were students at the University of Glasgow. She was a former captain of the Scottish field hockey team, a competitive tennis player, and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Glasgow. They had four children; a daughter and three sons.\\nIn 1936, he moved to Massachusetts to become director of the research division at Worcester State Hospital only 1 year later. In 1936, he also published his first book, Objective and Experimental Psychiatry which introduced his belief that psychiatry should approach the study of human behavior in a rigorous, scientific fashion rooted in biology. His theories of behavior stressed the unity of the organism with the environment; the book also outlined experimental method and research design. Cameron believed firmly in clinical psychiatry and a strict scientific method.\\nIn 1938 he moved to Albany, New York, where he received his diplomate in psychiatry and thus was certified in psychiatry.

Hersh, it documented an intelligence operation against the anti-war movement, as well as \"break-ins, wiretapping and the surreptitious inspection of mail\" conducted since the 1950s. According to former CIA Official Cord Meyer, these disclosures \"Convinced large sections of the American public that the CIA had become a domestic Gestapo and stimulated an overwhelming demand for the wide-ranging congressional investigations that were to follow.\"\\nHersh had been tipped off to the possibility of an \"in house operation\" by an unidentified member of the CIA in spring of 1974. He embarked on an investigation, speaking to sources that included CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Angleton. Although he was not aware of its existence, Hersh uncovered much information that had been documented in the \"Family Jewels\", a report ordered by Director of Central Intelligence William Colby that chronicled CIA abuses over the past 25 years. The report would not be formally revealed to the public until 2007.\\n\\n\\n=== Monitoring of anti-war movement and Project MINARET ===\\n\\nThe article alleged that CIA agents had followed and photographed participants in the antiwar movement, as well as other demonstrations. It also reported that the CIA \"set up a network of informants who were ordered to penetrate antiwar groups\", and even placed an avowedly anti-war congressperson under surveillance while putting other lawmakers in a dossier on dissident Americans.\\nInstituted in 1967 by the NSA, Project MINARET\\'s purpose was to document \"Soviet, Chinese, and North Vietnamese influence over the militant civil rights and anti–Vietnam War movements\" for the CIA and FBI, according to historian Donald Critchlow.

In addition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952 that asked, \"Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, such as self-preservation?\"\\nProject Artichoke was the Central Intelligence Agency\\'s secret code name for carrying out in-house and overseas experiments using LSD, hypnosis and total isolation as forms of physiological harassment for special interrogations on human subjects. At first agents used cocaine, marijuana, heroin, peyote and mescaline, but they increasingly saw LSD as the most promising drug. The subjects who left this project were fogged with amnesia, resulting in faulty and vague memories of the experience. In 1952, LSD was increasingly given to unknowing CIA agents to determine the drug\\'s effects on unsuspecting people. One record states that an agent was kept on LSD for 77 days.\\nArtichoke researched the potential of dengue fever and other diseases. A declassified Artichoke memo read: \"Not all viruses have to be lethal… the objective includes those that act as short-term and long-term incapacitating agents.\"\\nThe CIA disputed which department would take over the operation. Finally, it was decided that an agent from the CIA research staff, former U.S. Army brigadier general Paul F. Gaynor, would oversee it. The CIA sought to establish control over what it perceived as the \"weaker\" and \"less intelligent\" segments of society, or for potential agents, defectors, refugees, prisoners of war and others. A CIA report states that if hypnosis succeeded, assassins could be created to assassinate \"a prominent [redacted] politician or if necessary, [an] American official.\" The overseas operations took place in locations throughout Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Teams were assembled to manage these operations and they were told to \"conduct at the overseas bases operational experiments utilizing aliens as subjects.\"\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCIA activities in the United States\\nFrank Olson\\nMKUltra\\nMKNAOMI\\nMKOFTEN\\nProject CHATTER\\nUnethical human experimentation in the United States\\n\\n\\n== Footnotes ==', metadata={'title': 'Project Artichoke', 'summary': \"Project Artichoke (also referred to as Operation Artichoke) was a project developed and enacted by the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for the purpose of researching methods of interrogation.\\nInitially known as Project Bluebird, Project Artichoke officially arose on August 20, 1951, and was operated by the CIA's Office of Scientific Intelligence.

A few months later, the Chemical Corps took over Detrick and established its secret Biologicals Warfare Laboratories.\\nAt Camp Detrick, Baldwin worked with industrial partners such as George W. Merck and the U.S. military to establish the top secret U.S. bioweapons program beginning in 1943, during World War II, a time when interest in applying modern technology to warfare was high. Olson also worked with ex-Nazis who had been brought into the country through Operation Paperclip on the utilization of aerosolized anthrax.\\nOlson was discharged from the Army in 1944 and remained at Detrick on a civilian contract, continuing his research into aerobiology. In 1949, he joined many other Detrick scientists in Antigua for Operation Harness, which tested the vulnerability of different animals to toxic clouds. In 1950, he was a part of Operation Sea-Spray, where the bacterium Serratia marcescens was released into the coastal mists of San Francisco through a minesweeper, reaching all of San Francisco\\'s 800,000 residents, as well as people living in eight surrounding cities. Olson traveled often to Fort Terry, a secret army base off Long Island, where toxins too deadly to be brought onto the U.S. mainland were tested.\\nThis was the period where senior military officials and CIA officers were becoming deeply troubled at Soviet progress, and feared they were heading towards mastery of microbe warfare. Their alarm led to the forming of the Special Operations Division at Detrick in spring of 1949, with the purpose of conducting research on covert ways to utilize chemical weapons. SOD was known as a \"Detrick within a Detrick\" due to its level of secrecy. Olson became acting chief of SOD within a year of its creation, originally invited to join by colleague and SOD\\'s first chief, John Schwab.\\nAt some point while assigned as a civilian U.S. Army contractor, Olson began working as a CIA employee.

There is currently no drug proven to cause consistent or predictable enhancement of truth-telling. Subjects questioned under the influence of such substances have been found to be suggestible and their memories subject to reconstruction and fabrication. When such drugs have been used in the course of investigating civil and criminal cases, they have not been accepted by Western legal systems and legal experts as genuine investigative tools. In the United States, it has been suggested that their use is a potential violation of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (the right to remain silent). Concerns have also been raised through the European Court of Human Rights arguing that use of a truth serum could be considered a violation of a human right to be free from degrading treatment, or could be considered a form of torture. It has been noted to be a violation of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture.\\n\"Truth serum\" was abused against psychotic patients as part of old, discredited practices of psychiatry and is no longer used. In a therapeutic context, the controlled administration of intravenous hypnotic medications is called \"narcosynthesis\" or \"narcoanalysis\".

Prisoners were forced into participating; they did not willingly volunteer and no consent was given for the procedures.

Aribert Heim conducted similar medical experiments at Mauthausen. At Buchenwald, Carl Værnet conducted experiments on homosexual prisoners in an attempt to \"cure\" homosexuality.\\nAfter the war, these crimes were tried at what became known as the Doctors\\' Trial, and the abuses perpetrated led to the development of the Nuremberg Code of medical ethics. During the Nuremberg Trials, 23 Nazi doctors and scientists were tried for the unethical treatment of concentration camp inmates, who were often used as research subjects with fatal consequences.

His death was initially regarded as a suicide, but subsequent investigations have raised questions of a coverup of an alleged murder.\\nThe title Wormwood is a double literary allusion: first to the Bible verse about a star that infects one-third of Earth\\'s waters and makes them bitter and poisonous, a reference to biological weapons (in particular, allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War), and the \\'bitter\\' effect on Eric Olson of his 60-year search for a resolution regarding the death of his father; secondly, to a line in Hamlet (whose story arc the documentary suggests parallels Eric\\'s own life), when Hamlet whispers, \"Wormwood, Wormwood\", at the moment its play-within-a-play implies evidentially that his father was, in fact, assassinated.  The documentary ends with Eric Olson describing the quest for the truth about his father\\'s death as \"Wormwood\", having consumed his whole life and with no possibility that any definitive answer, positive or negative, would have released him from the bitterness of the loss anyway. Errol Morris said that \"What Wormwood tries to do is tell a story about how we know what we know and how reliable is that knowledge.\"\\nA key piece of evidence the film relies on is a CIA assassination manual from 1953, which instructs agents, \"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.\"\\n\\n\\n== Cast ==\\n\\n\\n=== Interviews ===\\nEric Olson\\nDavid Rudovsky, family attorney\\nSeymour Hersh\\nStephen Saracco', metadata={'title': 'Wormwood (miniseries)', 'summary': \"Wormwood (stylized as 'WORMWO0D') is a 2017 American six-part docudrama miniseries directed by Errol Morris and released on Netflix on December 15, 2017.

The latter part of the word psychology derives from -λογία -logia, which means \"study\" or \"research\". The word psychology was first used in the Renaissance. In its Latin form psychiologia, it was first employed by the Croatian humanist and Latinist Marko Marulić in his book Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae (Psychology, on the Nature of the Human Soul) in the decade 1510-1520 The earliest known reference to the word psychology in English was by Steven Blankaart in 1694 in The Physical Dictionary. The dictionary refers to \"Anatomy, which treats the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.\"\\nΨ (psi), the first letter of the Greek word psyche from which the term psychology is derived, is commonly associated with the field of psychology.\\nIn 1890, William James defined psychology as \"the science of mental life, both of its phenomena and their conditions.\" This definition enjoyed widespread currency for decades. However, this meaning was contested, notably by radical behaviorists such as John B. Watson, who in 1913 asserted that the discipline is a natural science, the theoretical goal of which \"is the prediction and control of behavior.\" Since James defined \"psychology\", the term more strongly implicates scientific experimentation.

It developed a poison pen and exploding seashells to assassinate Fidel Castro.\\nIn September 1995, Ruth David replaced James Hirsch as Deputy Director for Science and Technology, and established three new offices: the Clandestine Information Technology Office, the Office of Advanced Analytical Tools, and the Office of Advanced Projects.

      "The Church Committee (formally the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) was a US Senate select committee in 1975 that  investigated abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Chaired by Idaho Senator Frank Church (D-ID), the committee was part of a series of investigations into intelligence abuses in 1975, dubbed the \"Year of Intelligence\", including its House counterpart, the Pike Committee, and the presidential Rockefeller Commission. The committee's efforts led to the establishment of the permanent US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n",
      "The most shocking revelations of the committee include Operation MKULTRA, which involved the drugging and torture of unwitting US citizens as part of human experimentation on mind control; COINTELPRO, which involved the surveillance and infiltration of American political and civil-rights organizations; and Family Jewels, a CIA program to covertly assassinate foreign leaders.\n",
      "It also unearthed Project SHAMROCK, a program in which the major telecommunications companies shared their traffic with the NSA, and officially confirmed the existence of this signals intelligence agency to the public for the first time.\n",

      "\n",
      "== Background ==\n",
      "By the early years of the 1970s, a series of troubling revelations had appeared in the press concerning intelligence activities. First came the revelations by Army intelligence officer Christopher Pyle in January 1970 of the US Army's spying on the civilian population and Senator Sam Ervin's Senate investigations produced more revelations. Then on December 22, 1974, The New York Times published a lengthy article by Seymour Hersh detailing operations engaged in by the CIA over the years that had been dubbed the \"family jewels\". Covert action programs involving assassination attempts on foreign leaders and covert attempts to subvert foreign governments were reported for the first time. In addition, the article discussed efforts by intelligence agencies to collect information on the political activities of US citizens.\n",
      "The creation of the Church Committee was approved on January 27, 1975, by a vote of 82 to 4 in the Senate.\n"
