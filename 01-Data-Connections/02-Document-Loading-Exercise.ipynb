      "Claude Elwood Shannon (April 30, 1916 – February 24, 2001) was an American mathematician, electrical engineer, computer scientist and cryptographer known as the \"father of information theory\". He was the first to describe the Boolean gates (electronic circuits) that are essential to all digital electronic circuits, and he built the first machine learning device, thus founding the field of artificial intelligence. He is credited alongside George Boole for laying the foundations of the Information Age. \n",
      "At the University of Michigan, Shannon dual degreed, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in both electrical engineering and mathematics in 1936. As a 21-year-old master's degree student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in electrical engineering, Shannon wrote his thesis demonstrating that electrical applications of Boolean algebra could construct any logical numerical relationship, thereby establishing the theory behind digital computing and digital circuits. The thesis has been claimed to be the most important master's thesis of all time, as in 1985, Howard Gardner described it as \"possibly the most important, and also the most famous, master's thesis of the century\", while Herman Goldstine described it as \"surely ... one of the most important master's theses ever written ... It helped to change digital circuit design from an art to a science.\" Shannon then graduated with a PhD in mathematics from MIT in 1940. \n",
      "Shannon also contributed to the field of cryptanalysis for national defense of the United States during World War II, including his fundamental work on codebreaking and secure telecommunications, writing a paper which is considered one of the foundational pieces of modern cryptography, and whose work \"was a turning point, and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography.\" \n",
      "His mathematical theory of communication laid the foundations for the field of information theory, with his famous paper being called the \"Magna Carta of the Information Age\" by Scientific American, along with his work being described as being at \"the heart of today's digital information technology\". \n",
      "His Theseus machine was the first electrical device to learn by trial and error. It is thus the first example of artificial intelligence. \n",
      "Rodney Brooks declared that Shannon was the 20th century engineer who contributed the most to 21st century technologies. Shannon's achievements are considered to be on par with those of Albert Einstein and Sir Isaac Newton in their fields.\n",

      "The Shannon family lived in Gaylord, Michigan, and Claude was born in a hospital in nearby Petoskey. His father, Claude Sr. (1862–1934), was a businessman and, for a while, a judge of probate in Gaylord. His mother, Mabel Wolf Shannon (1890–1945), was a language teacher, who also served as the principal of Gaylord High School. Claude Sr. was a descendant of New Jersey settlers, while Mabel was a child of German immigrants. Shannon's family was active in their Methodist Church during his youth.\n",
      "Most of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from Gaylord High School in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home, he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire telegraph system to a friend's house a half-mile away. While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the Western Union company.\n",
      "Shannon's childhood hero was Thomas Edison, whom he later learned was a distant cousin. Both Shannon and Edison were descendants of John Ogden (1609–1682), a colonial leader and an ancestor of many distinguished people.\n",
