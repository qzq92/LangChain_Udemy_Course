# Udemy Course: LangChain with Python BootCamp - Resources 
This repository is used for storing all the sample Jupyter notebooks (with edits made to codebase to read my own API key) based on Udemy course content as of May 2024. 

# Acknowledgement and Credits
Credits goes to Mr Jose Portilla of Pierian Training who has developed the Jupyter notebooks for this [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain-with-python-bootcamp/?couponCode=OF52424) conducted by him.


# Additional Notes:
- Please note that the LLM model used is OpenAI's ChatOpenAI API service which would require API key in order to work. Due to the risk of potential misuse of API key, it would not be included in this publicly available repo. 
- Please create your own API key should you need it for API calls to OpenAI's models, and save the key as a text string in a newfile named *openai_key.txt* for parsing during program execution. 
- Please be informed that credits must be topup to OpenAI sevice in order to ensure successful execution of LLM models in the notebooks. Charge rates for different models are available through this [link](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)
